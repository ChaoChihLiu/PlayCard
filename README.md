This is my final java assignment when I studied in uni.
The purpose of this playCard is to calculate total points 
and choose the best card combination with highest points (select 4 from 6 given cards)

how to calculation points:
1. 1 jack get 1 point
2. only 4 cards are in the same suit, then getting points.
3. at least 3 cards are number in a row, get 3 points.
4. any 2 cards in the same rank, get 2 points
  	  any 3 cards in the same rank, get 6 points
     any 4 cards in the same rank, get 12 points
5. sum of card value (rank) is 15
